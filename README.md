### Pushy Panels
Pushy Panels is a modular component that is able to be dragged into any level and work as intended from the get go (Designer would have to rotate it the correct way). It will then spawn panels randomly at the set spawn points on the pushy panels floor and start moving towards the end of the floor. Once the panel hits the end of the floor it will destroy itself and then respawn randomly at one of the spawn floors. If a player were to touch one of the moving panels they would get knocked back and ragdoll. This is just the basis for pushpanels and can be worked on even further for a more complex and enjoyable obstacle, see future work in the trello board for details. A bonus level idea of an endless runner in which here is one long bridge made out of pushy panel floors. The player would start on the left and have to navigate through the panels to be the last one alive. While the players run a kill volume which could be anything from a giant shark to a giant barrel, will follow matching the speed of the first player so that if players fall behind they will die. This is just one of many ideas that can be made from this mechanic.

### Bug Fixes
Bug fixes played a big part in my contribution to the game. As the game is rather small in the assests and mechanics department. After the inital couple of weeks there wasn't excactly much content to add to the game but to build upon the player and game mdoes. With Tom and Rory doing amazing work for this I was on the side lines assisting wheenver they needed help. This meant that I was able to work with and on a multitude of things throughout the game. In the last week there was many game breaking bugs that had to be fixed before the submission. So I spent this week peer programming with Tom to fix the majority of them. Below you are able to see the extent at which the programmers had to bu fix, with a lot of code bugs being level 5 importance which is game breaking.

### Trello Board
Originally I completed all of my trello tasks that I set for myself. With everything working like it, I sat down and thought about how I could make this component even better. The future work section is there for future improvements.
