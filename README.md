Bug fixes played a big part in my contribution to the game. As the game is rather small in the assests and mechanics department. After the inital couple of weeks there wasn't excactly much content to add to the game but to build upon the player and game mdoes. With Tom and Rory doing amazing work for this I was on the side lines assisting wheenver they needed help. This meant that I was able to work with and on a multitude of things throughout the game. In the last week there was many game breaking bugs that had to be fixed before the submission. So I spent this week peer programming with Tom to fix the majority of them. Below you are able to see the extent at which the programmers had to bu fix, with a lot of code bugs being level 5 importance which is game breaking.
